What information is contained in the following tables? What is the primary key for each table? Which tables can they join to? Hint: navigating a new SQL database involves both relying on documentation (such as the Northwind schema information above) and also using your intuition and exploration.

categories: CategoryID

customers: CustomerID

employees: EmployeeID

products: ProductID

orders: OrderID



What categories of products are sold in this database?

SELECT CATEGORYNAME FROM  categories;

How many products per category does the catalog contain?

SELECT categoryid,count(categoryid) FROM  products
group by categoryid;


Let's focus only on products that have not been discontinued => how many products per category?

SELECT categoryid,count(categoryid) FROM  products
group by categoryid
having discontinued=0;

What are the most expensive five products (not discontinued)?

SELECT productname,unitprice FROM  products
where discontinued=0
order by unitprice DESC
limit 5;

How many units of each of these five products are there in stock?

SELECT productname,unitprice, unitsinstock FROM  products
where discontinued=0
order by unitprice DESC
limit 5;


How many orders are there in total?

SELECT count(*) FROM  orders;

Which country is receiving the most orders?

Germany and USA

SELECT shipcountry, count(orderid) FROM  orders
group by shipcountry
order by count(orderid) desc;

Which country is receiving the least?

Norway

SELECT shipcountry, count(orderid) FROM  orders
group by shipcountry
order by count(orderid);


What customer is submitting the highest number of orders?

SAVEA: Save-a-lot Markets

SELECT customerid, count(orderid) FROM  orders
group by customerid
order by count(orderid) desc;



What is the average freight weight per order, by customer?

SELECT customerid, AVG(freight) FROM orders
group by customerid,orderid;

What are all unique cities that customers are located in that begin with R?


SELECT distinct city FROM  customers where city like 'r%';

How many countries are customers located in that are not the UK or the US?
Can you use LIKE? Why or why not?

SELECT distinct country FROM customers where not (country like '%UK%' or country like 'USA');

How many customers are in each country (not including the UK or the US)?

SELECT country,count(customerid) FROM customers
where not (country like '%UK%' or country like â€™USA')
group by country;


Which employees have less than 100 total orders (from the orders table)? Please include their titleofcourtesy, firstname, and lastname


SELECT employees.titleofcourtesy,employees.firstname, employees.lastname,orders.employeeid, count(orders.orderid)
FROM orders
inner join employees on orders.employeeid = employees.employeeid
group by employees.employeeid
having count(orders.orderid)<100
;

Extra credit: Research the || operator to concatenate results and join those three fields into one.


SELECT employees.titleofcourtesy||' '||employees.firstname||' '||employees.lastname,orders.employeeid, count(orders.orderid)
FROM orders
inner join employees on orders.employeeid = employees.employeeid
group by employees.employeeid
having count(orders.orderid)<100
;
